    <h2>An easy meal to whip up after work without needing the grill.</h2>
    <p>
      A last-minute quick meal turned into a family favorite. Best homemade
      skillet burgers I have ever had and they are surprisingly not too bad for
      you! Making them into sliders on lightly toasted sourdough is an amazing
      gourmet treat for guests! My boyfriend got out the ketchup, and after one
      bite of these burgers he put the ketchup away. These burgers are perfect
      as-is--you don't even need buns!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds lead ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup egg whites</li>
      <li>1/3 chopped and drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes</li>
      <li>3 ounces crumbled goat cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon steak seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Lightly oil a large skillet and put over low heat.</li>
      <li>
        Mix ground beef, egg whites, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, sea salt,
        steak seasoning, and parsley in a large bowl. Shape into 5 hamburger
        patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put patties in the skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another
        5 minutes. Increase heat to medium or medium-high, cover, and continue
        to cook, flipping occasionally, until burgers are cooked through and
        juicy, 5 to 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top with
        liquid hickory smoke seasoning.
